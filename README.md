# Collision-Animations-and-Sound
Collision Detection and Sound JavaScript Project

This project uses JavaScript to implement collision detection and sound effects. The collision detection is based on what was learned from freeCodeCamp.org and the sound effects are sourced from OpenGameArt.org.

How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the player object around the canvas.
4. Observe collision detection and sound effects.

How it Works
.
When a animation is activated, the playSound function is called to play a sound effect.

Resources

The collision animation is based on tutorials from freeCodeCamp.org
The sound effects are sourced from OpenGameArt.org

Note

The collision animation and sound effects are just a basic example, you can customize and improve it as per your requirement.
